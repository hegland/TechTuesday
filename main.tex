\section{Examples}

For this we use the vscode extension \texttt{LaTeX Workshop} 
and the the Copilot extension \texttt{GitHub Copilot} with 
the chat extension \texttt{GitHub Copilot Chat}.
It uses \texttt{TeXlive} and the \texttt{latexmk} command.

% a first lemma

\begin{lemma}
    All principle submatrices of a 
    symmetric positive-semidefinite matrix are
    symmetric positive-semidefinite.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let $A\in \R^{n,n}$ be a symmetric positive-semidefinite matrix and 
    let $B\in\R^{k,k}$ be a principle submatrix of $A$. 
    Furthermore, as $B$ is a principle submatrix of $A$, there exists
    a matrix $E\in\R^{n,k}$ such that $B = E^T A E$, 
    has only elements in $\{0,1\}$ and $E^T E=I$.
    It follows that $B$ is symmetric positive-semidefinite.
\end{proof}

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's a clearer version of the same text:

\begin{proof}
Let $A\in \R^{n,n}$ be a symmetric positive-semidefinite matrix, 
and let $B\in\R^{k,k}$ be a principal submatrix of $A$. This 
means that $B$ is obtained by selecting $k$ rows and $k$ columns 
of $A$, and arranging them into a square matrix. Since $B$ is 
a principal submatrix of $A$, there exists a matrix 
$E\in\R^{n,k}$ such that $B = E^T A E$, where $E$ has only 
elements in $\{0,1\}$ and $E^T E=I$. This means that $B$ is 
also symmetric positive-semidefinite.
\end{proof}
